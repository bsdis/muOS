=== Development

MµOS are developed for the avr-gcc/avr-libc toolchain, on 8-bit AVR's (ATTiny,
ATMega) with some portability in mind. It is later planned to extend this to
other platforms like 32bit ARM (STM32). Direction is still to stay as simple
as the avr toolchain is to make mirgration for any programmer coming from
Atmel programming to STM32 (and perhaps others) as easy as possible. Still we
will make no compromises in functionality where required.

As Free Software project, mµOS is open to any contributor. Development will
progress on demand. Whatever is needed will be integrated.
