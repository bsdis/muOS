* Dependencies
  When versions are noted, this are the versions which are proven to work (in
  my development environment) if for some reason only older versions are
  available and work for you, please report this. The exact package names may
  differ depending on the Distribution you are using.

  - git
    For cloning and maintaining the source tree

  - make (>= 4.0)
    GNU make

  - gcc-avr (>= 4.7)
    GNU C compiler, version 4.7 is needed at least for '__flash' memory
    support. MÂµOS relies on -flto which will improve with newer Compiler versions.

  - avr-libc (>= 1.8)
    The GNU libc for AVR processors

  - binutils-avr
    Tools for building

  - avrdude (>= 6.1)
    Needed for flashing via USBasp or Arduino bootloaders (and possibly some
    more in future)

  - micronucleus (>= 2.0)
    Needed for flashing micronucleus based bootloaders (DigiSpark and other
    attiny based products)
