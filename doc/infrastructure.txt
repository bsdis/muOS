mµOS comes comes with a Makefile managing all project tasks. For the example
Project bundled with the mµOS source, everytihng is configured inside this
Makefile (this may be refined in future).

==== Build System

The build-system tries to do exact dependency tracking and building things in
parallel. There are sub Makefiles to support different flashing tools and
different platforms.

By default the make output is quite silent. If one adds the "MAKE_DEBUG=1"
flag to the make invocation then parallel builds are disabled and the it
produces verbose output.

Following main build targets are available:

all::
        Builds everything

upload::
        Flashes the firmware to the target

doc::
        Build the documentation

issues::
        Extracts +muos_issues.txt+ and builds +muos_issues.html+

clean::
        Deletes anything that got build


==== Documenation

The Documentation is writiten in 'asciidoc' and distributed in serveral .txt
files and added as special comments to the sources. The 'pipadoc' tool
included with mµOS is used to extract this Documentation into single text
files. For building the Documentation one needs a 'lua' interpreter, the
'asciidoc' toolchain and perhaps 'dblatex' for pdf generation. Because of
these dependencies building the documentation kept optional.

==== Issues

Issues are (only) tagged inside source and documentation files. 'pipadoc'
takes care of generating a +muos_issues.txt+ and +muos_issues.html+.
There are deliberately only 3 tags for issues:

+FIXME+::
        Known bug/problem which leads to failures and must be fixed.

+TODO+::
        Intended functionality which is not yet implemented/finished. If not
        used this should not run into errorneous behaviour.

+PLANNED+::
        Notes about future features and ideas, may be subject to refinement
        and should not affect the existing functionality at all.
