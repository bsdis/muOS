=== Serial

The Serial driver which operates directly on the hardware UART.

The UART runs asynchronously driven by interrupts. Data is transferred byte by
byte with immediate cyclic buffers.

Access to the UART is always non-blocking, requests which can't be served
returning or flagging an error.

At startup the receiver can be configured to be in in desynched state
and waits for a character to appear in the stream where it changes
into the synchronized state and data can be read.  This ensures that
only complete lines are returned to the program. Details can be be
configured. In future it will also synchronize when the line is idle.
