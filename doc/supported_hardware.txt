== Supported Hardware

Hardware support is added on demand. The following Platforms are tested and
known to work. But not all features are supported on all microcontrollers.
Other ones may work and can be added with little effort.


=== AVR

attiny84::
        Bare chip, programmed with usbasp/avrdude.

attiny85::
        Digispark (http://digistump.com/products/1) with micronucleus
        bootloader.

atmega328p::
        Arduino Nano. This is the reference Platform. Most things are tested
        and developed here.
