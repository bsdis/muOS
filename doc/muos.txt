=== The Mainloop

In default configuration mµOS provides a mainloop which schedules queues
holding user-defined functions to be called. 'main()' is part of mµOS and not
defined in user programs.

PIPADOC:FIXME: document that functions must disable interrupts

At start up mµOS first schedules a (configurable) 'init()' function which does
the initialization defined by the user. This init is called with the timer and
drivers still uninitialized/stopped, second after the 'init()' function
'muos_start()' is scheduled which then sets up all drivers and starts the
timer. Upon its completion everything is initialized and the system runs.

Some drivers provide configurable hooks which are scheduled when some event
happened (examples are like lineedit completed with the user pressing
+[RETURN]+)

For every iteration the mainloop sets a global variable to the current time
which then can be queried with 'muos_now()'. This time guaranteed to stay
stable for the whole mainloop iteration with only the exceptions that nested
mainloop invocation ('muos_wait()' and 'muos_yield()' will update it). Using
this should be the preferred way to get the current time over the direct clock
api's because it is faster to access and provides the necessary stability as
time tag for this iteration.

If there are any pending errors left from asynchronous calls (Interrupts and
Drivers) it may call a user defined error handler. This is done at highest
priority with interrupts still disabled. The error-handler is called only once
per mainloop iteration, even if it leaves errors pending.

Then the mainloop checks if there is any work on the queues (see below) and
executes these functions appropriately. When there is nothing left to do it
either puts the µC into sleep or, for very short times, does a busy loop to
ensure exact timing.

=== Scheduler Queues

There are few queues served by the mainloop. Each of them can be
configured in some details and disabled if not required.

==== clock priority queue

Uses the clock to wake the mainloop for scheduling events in 'future'.

Events scheduled by the clpq have the second highest priority, but are still
called synchronously within the mainloop and interrupts enabled.


===== clpq API


PIPADOC:=clpq_api

===== clpq configuration

Only the length is configured for the 'clpq', most of its configurations come
from the clock configuration see below.

PIPADOC:@clpq_config


==== Work Queues

The main-loop will schedule work on the Workqueues until nothing left to be
done. Work is always popped from the front of these queues.

One can push an optional 'intptr_t' arguments together with each
scheduled function to pass data. When this is used, functions *must*
pop this arguments.

The underlying queue implementation in <<lib_queue>> can be configured in
several ways.

==== realtime priority queue

Scheduled with highest priority. Use for offloading tasks from
interrupts for example.

===== rtq configuration

==== high priority queue

Scheduled with a priority below the clpq and above bgq. Usually most
work will be done in this queue.

===== hpq API

PIPADOC:=hpq_api

===== hpq configuration

PIPADOC:@hpq_config

==== background queue

Scheduled with the lowest priority. Used for things which have no
timing hard constraints.

=== The Clock

The 'clock' is one of the most important parts of the OS. Many core parts and
other drivers rely on it.

Only one hardware timer is used mµOS to implement the global clock. This can
be any timer (8bit, 16bit). MµOS uses its overflow interrupt and needs one
compare-match unit timer for scheduling wake ups. The configuration of this
timer (prescaler, which hardware timer to be used) is fully customize-able to
the user.

The clock is started at the begin of the operations (after the users 'init'
job got called) and then left freely running.

The clock API also holds a function to calibrate the µC main frequency with
some external signal, as far this is supported by the hardware.

.Datatypes

The full time is defined by the global overflow counter and the timers
internal hardware register. This overflow counter can be selected from various
unsigned integer types (16, 32, 64 bit wide), the internal timer counter
register extends this value by its size, enabling rather high resolution
clocks from 24 up to 80 bits precision. Depending on the circumstances one
should select a proper size so that overflows don't happen or do not matter.


There are following types used:

+muos_clock+::
 Generic type used for moderate long time spans. Depending on configuration
 it overflows rarely (or preferably never). This is the primary datatype for
 the clock and the 'global overflow counter'

+muos_shortclock+::
 Type for short time intervals. Used in the clock priority for events which
 are scheduled within shorter times.

+muos_hwclock+::
 The type of the hardware timer. Usually 8 or 16 bits wide

+muos_fullclock+::
  a structure containing the whole clock state with the high bits stored
  as muos_clock and the low bits stored as muos_hwclock. When properly
  configured this state should never overflow for the application run time.

.Some conclusions about the Datatypes

* The default for the overflow counter is 'uint32_t', calculations show that
  16bit makes hardly any sense, because it would overflow quite often even in
  slow increment configurations.

* More than 32 bit is only needed for fast running clocks or when very long
  run times are intended.

* Choosing 16 bit hwclock when it is available will have less interrupt
  load but needs more memory. When in doubt, it is not mandatory when the
  timer prescaler is not on the fastest setting. This is especially useful if
  only one 16 bit timer is available and is needed for something else.
  However some mµOS drivers may require a 16 bit timer.

* 'muos_clock' alone overflows quite often but using a 64 bit datatype for it
  would need a lot memory in the queues (and 64 bit math libs).

//* use 'fullclock' for ltpq scheduling, 'clock' alone would need another
//       sliding window pq implementation with no much benefits.

=== Error handling

Errors can happen synchronously by returning a error code directly from the
called function or asynchronously by setting a flag from interrupts and
drivers. This two approaches are necessary because errors can not always be
handled where they happen.

The synchronous way is quite straightforward. If a function does return
anything but 'muos_success' some error happened and can be handled right away.

Asynchronous errors are different as they can be flagged at any time (from
interrupts) which can not handle them appropriately. There is a flag
(bitfield) for any possible errorcode, but these don't queue up. This means
asynchronous errors need to be handled as soon as possible.

For to do this mµOS supports a global error handling function which is called
in the main-loop when any error is pending. This error handling function has
the highest priority and upon enter, interrupts are still disabled. It is
advised to enable interrupts there as soon as possible (there is no need to
disabled them again, the main-loop takes care of that). The global error
handling function only needs to handle most important failures. Any errors not
handled there can be handled elsewhere from normal queued functions as well.

Errors can be flagged and checked, checking for an error automatically clears
the flag. There is also a function to check if an error flag is set without
clearing it.

==== Error codes

The following error codes are used nby mµOS, depending on configuration, some
might be disabled when the respective subsystem/driver is not enabled.
