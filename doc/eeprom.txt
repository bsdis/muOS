=== EEPROM

There are two drivers available for storing data within the
microcontrollers EEPROM. The lowlevel 'EEPROM' driver allows
asynchronous basic access to the eeprom data. Including reading,
writing, verifying and erasing data.

The higher level 'configstore' driver implements a more robust, fault
tolerant and wear leveling algorithm on top of the 'EEPROM'
facilities.

Both drivers operate asynchronous for reading and writing. Upon
completion or failure a registered callback function is scheduled. By
its nature EEPROM is considered slow and less timing critical, thus it
prefers to schedule callbacks on the BGQ when available.
